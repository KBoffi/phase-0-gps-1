* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to the session, I was still a bit confused about steps 6 and 7 of the Git Workflow (merge master branch into feature branch; and merge feature branch into master branch) as they relate to GitHub workflow. 

I was also unsure what git fetch and git merge were and when they were supposed to be used, as I thought git pull could do the same thing. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Both of these questions were clarified by my guide in GPS 1.1, which was great. I wasn't aware we could ask questions so freely and get so much additional information. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair about how to open files from the command line. Opening and moving files there still confuses me a little. 

I asked my guide about steps 6 & 7 in Git Workflow as they relate to GitHub workflow. 

* What still confuses you about Git?

I am feeling a lot more confident about Git than at the time of the week 1 Review and Reflect. Collaborators is a new concept and is a little confusing to me. From now on, will our repos always stay connected?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I really enjoyed it! It can be hard to go through all of these challenges on your own without anyone with whom to compare notes, bounce ideas off of, or ask questions. I was intimidated and apprehensive about the GPS but felt really relaxed during it. The time went by really quickly.

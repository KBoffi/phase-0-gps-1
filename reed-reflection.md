*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
..*I was struggling with merging my branches, particularly when to merge feature branchs to the master branch and vice versa. 
*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
..*We asked about merging branches, I also asked about making changes that are not on the same line if that can cause a merge conflict. 

*What still confuses you about Git?
..*Merging branches! There is a lot of movement between the master and feature branches so I often get confused with when to merge changes to the master and if I should do it after every edit. 

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
..*It was great! I enjoyed it a lot! My guide was very insightful and my partner was also very patient and good at communicating with me while we alternated roles.
